# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Tarides GitHub Organization ðŸ‘‹

At Tarides, we are dedicated to advancing the OCaml programming
language by developing and maintaining a range of open-source tools
and libraries. Our mission is to enhance OCaml's capabilities,
support its community, and promote its adoption across various
industries.

## Our Open-Source Projects

We contribute to several key areas within the OCaml ecosystem:

### OCaml Compiler

We focus on ensuring that the [OCaml compiler](https://github/ocaml/ocaml)
retains its fine balance of ease of use, correctness, and performance
while evolving to include new features. This includes developing new
language-based tools for specification-based testing, fuzzing, and
verification of OCaml code. In 2022, Tarides introduced multicore
support for shared-memory parallelism and concurrency to OCaml 5.0,
bringing years of development, award-winning research, and
groundbreaking code into mainline OCaml.

### OCaml Platform

Our goal is to provide OCaml users with a set of high-quality,
practical development tools backed by the latest research and
innovation efforts. We develop and maintain core tools such as:

- [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com): Editor extension for OCaml.
- [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org): OCaml package manager tool and plugins.
- [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune): OCaml build system.
- [Merlin](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin): Modern IDE for OCaml.
- [Odoc](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc): Documentation generator.
- [OCamlformat](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat): OCaml code formatter.

### OCaml.org

Since 2012, [OCaml.org](https://ocaml.org) has been the central
knowledge base for the community to connect, access resources, and get
the latest OCaml news. We work with community contributors to maintain
and develop the site, appealing to both new and experienced OCaml
users.

### MirageOS

[MirageOS](https://mirageos.org) is an operating system that
constructs unikernels for secure, high-performance applications across
various cloud computing and mobile platforms.

We are also working on [Irmin](https://irmin.org), a distributed
database that leverages the same concepts as Git, offering version
control for data in MirageOS unikernels. Irmin is designed to
facilitate storage and synchronization needs in MirageOS environments,
making it easier to build robust, reproducible systems; but it is also
useful in other areas, such as blockchains.

We are dedicated to further developing MirageOS and supporting a
thriving ecosystem of developers and users.
